Any AMPL model would typically read the input from a data file. There are two kinds of inputs that one can pass -
1. Sets - These are indexes (more like numbering lists that help us identify location of various parameters)
2. Parameters - These are data points that will feed into our model

Let's have a look at a sample data file
