# Welcome to Linear Programming
Linear Programming is widely used to solve operational problems. This guide walks you through an introduction to AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) and how you can use this language in order to code your linear programming problems and solve a lot of challenging business problems. We will explain the syntax through various small examples in this folder and you can then look into the sub-folders to understand sample problems and solutions.

# What is AMPL, what does it do?
AMPL is an algebraic modeling language to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing. It was developed by Robert Fourer, David Gay, and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.

# How does a simple model look like?
There are 3 parts to building an AMPL model - 
1. The data file (*.dat) - This file allows you to specify input parameters
2. The model file (*.mod)- This file contains the objective, the list of constraints and associated variable declarations
3. The run file (*.run) - This file contains the file locations, the solver type and the outputs that you want from the model

# How do I use this repository?
There are sample codes in this repository. You could pick them up and modify them as per your requirements. You can also look at the sample cases to see if your challenge is similar in nature (each case is there in a folder).

# What do I do, if my problem isn't listed here?
You have two available resources.
1. Look at the [AMPL guide](https://ampl.com/resources/the-ampl-book/chapter-downloads/)
2. Drop a comment below and I would get back to you :)
